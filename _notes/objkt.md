<blockquote><i>initial draft i scrapped because i rambled too long: I recently visited Western Mono land (presently known as Sequoia, CA) and found myself among ancient giants. Trees pre-dating me by thousands of years cast shadows on my entire existence and as I meandered through these sacred groves--my neck craned up towards the canopy. I couldn’t help but feel as insignificant as a conscious being could. / For every day that we relish our egos with accolades and validation and dopamine and wins, we make it harder for ourselves to feel failure, to feel humility, to feel… insignificant. But if there’s anything that I’m certain of, it’s the importance of claiming these latter feelings in the same way we claim the former--with pride and ownership and  There in that grove, I couldn’t help but feel truly awestruck by the fact that I really am just a lucky cluster of cells. To be small and therefore liberated from all the implications that everything I do has to be some big perfect meaningfully significant super awesome thing. / And so, there are layers to this collection. On the surface, they’re these little dreamscape worlds that I imagine would exist in the morning dew or the lint on the window sill. These places have characters just like us, and they go about their lives just like us, and maybe they know how small they are, and maybe they don’t (I personally don’t want to be the first to tell them), but I digress. To be small does not exclude one from being whole. Small but rich, cultivated, and expressive</i></blockquote>
