[Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) wrote a really good brief on digital gardening that convinced me to get started. The tldr is this:

1. transparent note-taking 
2. open source 
3. wiki like network

The goal of digital gardening is to [create an environment that grows and evolves naturally over time](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) and by doing so, the need for perfect content is eradicated.

On a personal note, I'm a feind for long form content and I've been dissatisfied with current blogging platforms (but I will continue to maintain [mine](https://geminiworms.weebly.com)). I also wanted a reason to dabble in html/css (see my scatterbrained [colophon](/colophon){: .internal-link}). 

Here's a running list of digital gardens I enjoy:
