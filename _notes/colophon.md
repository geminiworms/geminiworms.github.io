title: how did i do this
---

ok bear with me.

#### the basic techy stuff
This is a static site generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). All my code and content sits comfy in a [Github](https://github.com) repository.
I developed this site on Windows 10 using Ubuntu... unsurprisingly, the documentation for this was difficult to navigate and troubleshoot until I stumbled upon [Virtual Goods Dealer](https://pages.virtualgoodsdealer.com/articles/2020/11/23/simple-website-tutorial-part-two/#windows-setting-up-bash). Note that this documentation is a little outdated. Be sure to reference the latest versions of packages mentioned. 
I use [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to deploy my site and host it on my custom domain. A word of advice (since no tutorial cautioned me about this); if you're using a custom domain, deploy with netlify, not gh pages. I don't know the theory, but it just didn't work for me. Anyways...

#### the look
I used this [digital garden jekyll template](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) by Maxime Vaillancourt. I haven't tinkered with it yet so this section is going to be appended in time.

#### honorable mentions
I love the [jekyll bonsai template](https://jekyll-bonsai.netlify.app/post/0b9db15818/#clone) by manunamz, and originally tried using it for my own site. I ultimately decided against it (clearly) because I'm unsure if my garden is going to need so much metadata.

##### disclaimer
I have no web dev coding experience at all... unless you count tumblr html. However, I am a novice in bioinformatics so I started this endeavor with basic understanding of git, bash, and directory management. If you follow the [Virtual Goods Dealer](https://pages.virtualgoodsdealer.com/articles/2020/11/16/simple-website-tutorial-part-one/) static website tutorial from the beginning, I believe you will have all the basic understanding necessary to get your garden going. Otherwise, I am also here to help!
