#### text & ideas to prompt reflection

1. I saw [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd50SeUOqoN/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link): "I've been thinking deeply about the question 'how do you know if you are truly happy or just making the best out of a situation'. This question is haunting because we know a lot of us struggle to validate our own emotions as adults. We learned very young that suppressing how we feel is how we survive in this world..."
2. From a [tiktok by @foreverurmuse](https://www.tiktok.com/@foreverurmuse/video/7103249955715943722?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7083395689336604206): "do you ever think about how much unaddressed subconscious anger we all have; and how we use 'activism' as a guise to release our anger? activism is in quotes because real activist work is transformative, but this quise is often seen as angry, online rants/graphic design posters with no irl action"
