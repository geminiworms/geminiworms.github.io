[Documentation](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/?a=00ea59df43) /
[Repo](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/hello-world-tutorial) <br>
**Goal: build, deploy, interact, verify a smart contract** <br>
Tools: alchemy, metamask, hardhat
- Alchemy: node provider
- Metamask: wallet
- Hardhat: test ground
Getting test eth from [Ropsten Test Network](https://faucet.dimensions.network/)
- I set up a "tester" wallet, then make sure to enable test networks
- I dont see a pending transaction on etherscan... so not sure how long this might take
Setting up app on alchemy
