### i'm thinking about these albums that represent a very distinct time for their respective generations

#### Lorde, Pure Heroine (September 2013)

#### Olivia Rodrigo, SOUR (May 2021)

### and I'm wondering...
because it's not like these are the only coming of age albums there are... but what makes these so poignant? What made these pop albums? Especially in the case of Lorde, who was not a star before her single debut. There are plenty of songs that represent the feminine transformation, but what is it about these that made it *ubiquitous*? 

*what universal experiences do these albums represent?*
