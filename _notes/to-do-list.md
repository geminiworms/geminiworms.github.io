### stuff I'm building
I'm new to css/html and so if you ran into a 404, it's probably because I haven't quite figured it out yet.
I'll keep this list as updated as possible just as a reference and also as an invitation for feedback.
Here's [my repo](https://github.com/geminiworms/geminiworms.github.io) for reference.

### 1. creating a photogallery layout 
I'm inspired by [alisa.wtf's photo galleries](https://alisa.wtf/plants) and am hoping to translate her [code](https://github.com/alisasgithub/alisa-digital-garden/blob/main/_layouts/photoessay.html) to work in my own site. <br>
I'm also trying out [this guide](https://dmnfarrell.github.io/software/jekyll-galleries) for a photo gallery `_includes` situation... 

and I'll have to play with it more to make sure my paths line up right to my repo. Testing grounds are on [[moodboard]] <br>
so I think I might have a bit of a fix using [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp) the only problem I'm having is running this formatting through loops.
