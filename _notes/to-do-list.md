### stuff I'm building
I'm new to css/html and so if you ran into a 404, it's probably because I haven't quite figured it out yet.
I'll keep this list as updated as possible just as a reference and also as an invitation for feedback.
Here's [my repo](https://github.com/geminiworms/geminiworms.github.io) for reference.

#### current:
1. [[on celebration]] page is lacking the grid map! Maybe it has to do with the instagram post embeds? since that's probably the only unique thing i've added on that note in comparsion to others 

### finished!
1. I used this code for a [responsive photo grid](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_grid_responsive.asp) to create a image gallery inspired by [alisa.wtf's photo galleries](https://alisa.wtf/plants). Some code I also considered using was [this guide](https://dmnfarrell.github.io/software/jekyll-galleries) for a photo gallery `_includes` situation... Ideally, it would've been a generative loop the read photo files out of a directory, but it seems like for now, I'm just working with it as a local grid.
2. I added a site thumbnail using `<meta property="og:image" content="path" />` in my `head.html` file
