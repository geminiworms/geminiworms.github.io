I'm Talyssa, thanks for stopping by.

  <hr>
<p>I'm writing to you from my messy little desk in my messy little studio apartment in too-expensive-for-an-early-career-mid-twenty-year-old-in-student-debt *Southern California*. The way I describe myself to you kind of depends on why you're here...

  #### I'm here because I'm interested in your work
  Great! I'm a PhD Candidate in Microbiolgy. I did my B.S. in Biology & minor in Biochemistry at Loyola Marymount University. I thought I was pre-med (didn't we all?) until I started my research in plant-microbial symbioses (specifically, N-fixation of rhizobacterium in sweet pea). You can take a gander at my previous research experiences on my [bi-annually updated linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/talyssa-topacio-190012147/) My applications for grad school were absolute shots in the dark... I completely pivoted into human-microbial symbioses, got myself admitted, and now here I am; full *Candidate* status. My current project sits at the interface of clinical and environmental microbiogy with intentions to examine the lung microbiome in the context of environmental dust exposures. If you're interested in chatting more about this stuff, connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/T4LYSSA)!
